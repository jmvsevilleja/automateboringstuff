# Bolean Operators
# and or not

# The Boolean operators have an order of operations just like the math operators do. After any math and comparison operators evaluate,
# Python evaluates the not operators first, then the and operators, and then the or operators.

# While Loop Statements
# same as if

# For Loop and range()
